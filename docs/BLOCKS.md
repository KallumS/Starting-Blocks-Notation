# The catalogue

Every block Starting Blocks Notation can make, and exactly what each one is.

**This file is generated.** Run
`python3 tools/run_lua.py tools/blocks_md.lua > docs/BLOCKS.md` to rebuild
it. It loads `reascripts/sb_engine.lua` and reads its tables, so it cannot
drift from what the script actually does.

## Keys

18 roots: `C`, `C#`, `Db`, `D`, `D#`, `Eb`, `E`, `F`, `F#`, `Gb`, `G`, `G#`, `Ab`, `A`, `A#`, `Bb`, `B`, `Cb`.

Both spellings of every pitch class are offered, plus `Cb`, because C# major
and Db major are the same seven notes written differently and the difference
is what the note names come out as. These are ScaleView for REAPER's roots,
unchanged.

## Scales

Semitones from the root. Also ScaleView's, unchanged, so the two apps agree
on what a scale is.

| scale | semitones | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Major | 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 | 7 |
| Minor | 0 2 3 5 7 8 10 | 7 |
| Harm Minor | 0 2 3 5 7 8 11 | 7 |
| Ionian | 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 | 7 |
| Dorian | 0 2 3 5 7 9 10 | 7 |
| Phrygian | 0 1 3 5 7 8 10 | 7 |
| Lydian | 0 2 4 6 7 9 11 | 7 |
| Mixolydian | 0 2 4 5 7 9 10 | 7 |
| Aeolian | 0 2 3 5 7 8 10 | 7 |
| Maj Pent | 0 2 4 7 9 | 5 |
| Min Pent | 0 3 5 7 10 | 5 |
| Maj Blues | 0 2 3 4 7 9 | 6 |
| Min Blues | 0 3 5 6 7 10 | 6 |
| Whole Tone | 0 2 4 6 8 10 | 6 |
| Dim W-H | 0 2 3 5 6 8 9 11 | 8 |
| Dim H-W | 0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 | 8 |

## Scale degrees

The degree buttons are Roman numerals, cased and marked for the triad the
scale itself builds on that degree: upper case for major, lower for minor,
`°` for diminished, `+` for augmented. That is read off the scale rather
than assumed, so the modes and the blues scales come out right - the vii of
major is `vii°`, the III of natural minor is `III`.

| degree | name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Tonic |
| 2 | Supertonic |
| 3 | Mediant |
| 4 | Subdominant |
| 5 | Dominant |
| 6 | Submediant |
| 7 | Leading Tone |

Only the seven-note scales have these names. In a pentatonic or a diminished
scale the degrees are simply numbered. The seventh is called a **Leading
Tone** only when it really is a semitone below the tonic; otherwise it is a
**Subtonic**.

## Blocks

**Chord**, **Arpeggio**, **Run**, **Melody**, **Bass**, **Drums**.

### Chords

The first family is built from the scale you picked, so it is always in key:

| shape | scale degrees above the one you chose |
| --- | --- |
| Triad | +0 +2 +4 |
| 7th | +0 +2 +4 +6 |
| 9th | +0 +2 +4 +6 +8 |
| 11th | +0 +2 +4 +6 +8 +10 |
| 13th | +0 +2 +4 +6 +8 +10 +12 |
| 6th | +0 +2 +4 +5 |
| sus2 | +0 +1 +4 |
| sus4 | +0 +3 +4 |
| 5th | +0 +4 |

The rest are absolute shapes, stacked on the degree you chose whether or not
they fit the key. Semitones are from the chord's root.

Chords can be inverted (root, 1st, 2nd, 3rd) and moved by up to three
octaves either way.

**Chop** cuts the block into segments and strikes the chord again in each
one: 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 or 1/1. At 1/1 over one bar that is a
single held chord, which is what a chord was before the chop existed. Over
more than one bar it is one strike a bar.

### Arpeggios

The chord from the Chord tab, one note at a time.

**Direction** lays every chord tone across the octave span out in pitch
order and then walks them: Up, Down, Up/Down, Down/Up, Random, Converge, Diverge.

`Random` is a shuffle rather than free picks, so every tone gets its turn
before any of them repeats. `Converge` works inwards from the outside,
`Diverge` outwards from the middle.

**Length** is measured one of two ways, and you pick which.

**Repeats** is how many times the pass plays, from 1 to 16. One pass is
one time through whatever the direction produced, so the block is as long as
the arpeggio and no longer - a triad up is three notes, a thirteenth up is
seven, and the same Repeats setting gives you one of each rather than a bar
of each.

**Bars** fills a length instead: the pass cycles until the block runs out,
wherever in the pass that falls. A one-bar block of eighth notes is eight
notes whether the chord under it has three tones or seven. This is how an
arpeggio worked before repeats existed, and it is the one to reach for when
the block has to line up with a bar rather than with itself.

### Runs

The same seven directions, but over the scale rather than the chord,
starting on the degree you chose and running up to four octaves. A
one-octave run is inclusive of the octave above, so it lands back on the
note it started from, and it is measured in repeats or in bars the same way
an arpeggio is.

### Melody

The two smallest moves a melody can make, and the one note that does not
move at all. An interval, a direction and a shape:

| interval | |
| --- | --- |
| 2nd | the step |
| 3rd | a leap |
| 4th | a leap |
| 5th | a leap |
| 6th | a leap |
| 7th | a leap |
| Octave | a leap |
| Sustain | one note, held for the rate |

| shape | |
| --- | --- |
| Single | the move: two notes |
| Return | there and back: three notes |
| Fill | every scale note in between |

All of it is diatonic: a 3rd is two scale steps, whatever that is in
semitones in this key, and an octave is however many steps this scale takes
to get there - five in a pentatonic, seven in a major scale.

Sustain has nothing to point in a direction and no shape to take, so the
panel puts the scale degree where the shape was - the same degree chosen in
step 2, shown again where it is the only thing left to choose.

### Bass

One note of the chord, on its own, low. Inversion is ignored here, so the
voices are always counted from the root: Root, 3rd, 5th, 7th.
Up to three octaves down, repeating at the chosen rate.

### Drums

One piece of the kit, hit at one rate. Stack a kit up by dropping in
several. The note numbers are General MIDI, so the blocks land on the right
pads in anything that follows the map.

There are no named patterns. The patterns fall out of the rates instead: a
kick every 1/4 is four on the floor, a kick every 1/2 is one and three, and
a snare - which starts on the two - every 1/2 is the backbeat. Naming those
would be naming what the rates already say.

| piece | note | first hit | every |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kick | 36 | top of the bar | 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 |
| Snare | 38 | beat 2 | 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 |
| Closed HH | 42 | top of the bar | 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 |
| Open HH | 46 | top of the bar | 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 |
| Crash | 49 | top of the bar | 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 |
| Ride | 51 | top of the bar | 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 |
| Low Tom | 41 | top of the bar | one hit only |
| Mid Tom | 47 | top of the bar | one hit only |
| High Tom | 50 | top of the bar | one hit only |

1/1 is always the last rate a piece offers, and it means a single hit. The
toms are a single hit and nothing to choose until they are thought through.
A bar too short to reach a piece's first hit gets no hit at all.

**Shuffle** pushes every second hit later, from 0 to 100. At 100 it lands
two thirds of the way through the pair, which is the triplet feel a shuffle
is named after; anything less is on the way there. A piece that is only hit
once has no second hit to push. Shuffle is measured against whatever the
step turned out to be, so it composes with a triplet rather than fighting it.

## Timing

| rate | 1/64 | 1/32 | 1/16 | 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quarter notes | 0.0625 | 0.125 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 4 |

Every block can be straight, triplet, dotted - a triplet is two thirds of the straight value, a dotted note one and a
half - and straight is where it starts. It is one setting shown on every
panel, because a block is in one feel or the other and it is the same
question wherever it is asked. It applies to whatever that panel reads as a
rate: the chord's chop, the spacing of a drum, and the step an arpeggio, run,
melody or bass line walks in. A block that is not straight says so in its
name, `T` for a triplet and `.` for a dotted one, so two feels of the same
rate are not two files fighting over one filename.

**Gate** is how much of the step the note actually holds, from 5% to 100%.

Chords, bass and drums are measured in **bars**: 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8. A bar is however long the
project's time signature says it is, and a quarter or a half of one is still
a block - a single chord stab is a quarter-bar chord. A drum pattern belongs
to a bar, so a block shorter than a bar keeps the front of the pattern and
drops the rest.

Arpeggios and runs take either of those lengths **or** a number of repeats.
A melody is however long its own notes make it.

Everything leaves at velocity 100. Shaping a block's
dynamics is a job for the MIDI editor once it is in the project, not for a
slider on every panel here.
